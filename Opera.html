    <h2>RUDDIGORE </h2>
    <h6 class="head">Act 02- Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle.  The walls are
        covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of
        Ruddigore from the time of James I.—the first being that of
        Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the
        last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.
        Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically.  They are greatly altered
        in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
        roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.

      RECITATIVE
     <h5 class="DES">DES</h5> <p>I once was a very abandoned person— </p>
     <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p >Making the most of evil chances. </p>
     <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p>Nobody could conceive a worse 'un— </p>
     <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p> Even in all the old romances. </p>
     <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p> I blush for my wild extravagances,
                    But be so kind
                        To bear in mind,</p>
     <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p> We were the victims of circumstances!</p>
                                                             <P class="direction">(The Ghosts return to their frames.)</P>
                                                             <p> That is one of our blameless dances.</p>

    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p>I was once an exceedingly odd young lady—</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p> Suffering much from spleen and vapours.</p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p>Clergymen thought my conduct shady—</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p>She didn't spend much upon linen-drapers.</p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p>It certainly entertained the gapers.
                        My ways were strange
                        Beyond all range—</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p> Paragraphs got into all the papers.</p>
                                                             <P class="direction">(He is

    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p> We only cut respectable capers.</p>
  
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5> <p>I've given up all my wild proceedings.</p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5> <p> My taste for a wandering life is waning.</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5> <p>Now I'm a dab at penny readings.</p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5> <p>They are not remarkably entertaining.</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5> <p>A moderate livelihood we're gaining.</p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5> <p>In fact we rule
                        A National School.</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5> <p>The duties are dull, but I'm not complaining.</p>
                                                             <P class="direction"> (aside)</P>
  
                 <p>This sort of thing takes a deal of training!</p>
  
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p>We have been married a week.</p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p> One happy, happy week!</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p> Our new life—</p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p> Is delightful indeed!</p>
    <h5 class="DES">DES</h5><p> So calm!</p>

    What in the world should the </p> <p class="direction">(young man\maiden) </p>
    <h5 class="MAR">MAR</h5><p> So unimpassioned!</p>  <P>(Wildly)</P> <p>Master, all this I owe
    to you!  See, I am no longer wild and untidy.  My hair is combed.
    My face is washed.  My boots fit!</p>
    <h5 class="ROB">ROB</h5><p>There, there—it's all right—he's married you
    now—that is, I've married you</p> <P class="direction"> (turning to Despard)</P><p> I say, which
    of us has married her?</p>
   <h5>Song</h5>
    <p class="song">Yes, I know, dear—it shan't occur again.  (He is
     seated—she sits on the ground by him.)  Shall I tell you one of
     poor Mad Margaret's odd thoughts?  Well, then, when I am lying
     awake at night, and the pale moonlight streams through the
     latticed casement, strange fancies crowd upon my poor mad brain,
     and I sometimes think that if we could hit upon some word for you
     to use whenever I am about to relapse—some word that teems with
     hidden meaning—like "Basingstoke"—it might recall me to my
     saner self.  For, after all, I am only Mad Margaret!  Daft Meg!
     Poor Meg!  He! he! he!</p>
