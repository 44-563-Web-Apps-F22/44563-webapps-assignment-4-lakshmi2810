    <h2>RUDDIGORE</h2>
    <h4>Act 02- Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle.  The walls are
        covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of
        Ruddigore from the time of James I.—the first being that of
        Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the
        last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.
 
   Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically.  They are greatly altered
        in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
        roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man. </h4>
        <p>      ROB.  I recognize you now—you are the picture that hangs at
                     the end of the gallery.<br>
                 SIR ROD.  In a bad light.  I am.<br>
                 ROB.  Are you considered a good likeness?<br>
                 SIR ROD.  Pretty well.  Flattering.<br>
                 ROB.  Because as a work of art you are poor.<br>
                 SIR ROD.  I am crude in colour, but I have only been painted
                 ten years.  In a couple of centuries I shall be an Old Master,
                  and then you will be sorry you spoke lightly of me.<br>
                 ROB.  And may I ask why you have left your frames?<br>
                 SIR ROD.  It is our duty to see that our successors commit
                 their daily crimes in a conscientious and workmanlike fashion.
                 It is our duty to remind you that you are evading the conditions
                 under which you are permitted to exist.<br>
                 ROB.  Really, I don't know what you'd have.  I've only been
                 a bad baronet a week, and I've committed a crime punctually every day.<br>
                 SIR ROD.  Let us inquire into this.  Monday?<br>
                 ROB.  Monday was a Bank Holiday.<br>
                 SIR ROD.  True.  Tuesday?<br>
                 ROB.  On Tuesday I made a false income-tax return.</p>
